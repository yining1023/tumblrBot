# Tumblr Bot

This bot is a fork from Craig Pickard's [100daysBot](https://github.com/Craigson/100days/tree/master/100daysBot).

This bot reblogs the work of every student participating in ITP's 100 Days of making class during the Spring semester of 2017. The bot searches for posts that contain the hashtag #100daysITP2017 and reblogs every new post from that day at midnight.

Here is the tumblr blog link: [https://100daysitp2017.tumblr.com/](https://100daysitp2017.tumblr.com/)
